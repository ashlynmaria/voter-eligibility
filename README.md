# 🗳️ Voter Eligibility Checker

Welcome! 🧙  
This is a fun and beginner-friendly Python project that checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.

## 📌 What It Does

This script asks the user how old they are and then:

- ✅ Tells them they're eligible to vote if they are **18 or older**
- ⏳ Tells them how many years they have left if they are **under 18**

## 💻 Example Runs

```bash
How old are you? 16
😅 Oops! You’re not eligible yet. But hey, only 2 more years to go!
